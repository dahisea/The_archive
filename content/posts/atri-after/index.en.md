"The planet is sinking—"

"Time passes, how cruel you are—"

First, it is divided into two main lines, and fixed options can be entered. This kind of plot is common among independent solo tearjerkers.

**good:**
Atri confronts Brother Yasuda. Atri becomes numb and tears off Yasuda's robotic arm. Xia Sheng arrived, and Arti realized that he had "emotions". He hugged Xia Sheng on the rooftop in pain and released the emotions of decades. In the end, Atri entrusted Xia Sheng to the second female lead before the rocket was launched, and he and Xia Sheng came to Eden, lit up the town, and agreed with Xia Sheng to spend the last day together after saving the world. Integrate with the system. rocket launch

**bad:**
Atri was numb, gave up on himself and killed Yasuda (although then Atri fell down the building and lost his feelings, and died two days later.

**te:**
Not long after Xia was born, he became old and frail. He made secret plans to invade Eden, telling only the second female lead. The consciousness was uploaded the day before Eden sank, and he spent 60 years with Atri.

> "Stop time, you are so beautiful"

### Atri, we have long admired your name.
Regarding the name of the protagonist, the translation is very thoughtful, Ya+Xia-Eden, which implies the bond between the male and female protagonists.
The story takes place in the background of a catastrophe, where the future of mankind is uncertain and the world is changing. The male protagonist is determined to find a way to redemption.

The male protagonist lost his mother and right leg when he was young, and his father was unable to accompany him for various reasons. He was grieving the loss of his wife and had to work hard. In this way, the male protagonist came to his grandmother's house and met Atri.

At first I thought it was an ordinary encounter. It wasn't until I experienced many flashbacks later that I realized that they met at the apex of grief and saved each other. Emotional weight gets. Both Atri and Xia Sheng committed suicide. It was precisely because Atri could not accept the fact of "having a heart" and it was precisely because she had it that she had this thought.

### "A robot will never mistake its owner."
In the accident, the male protagonist's mother, Atri's owner, issued an order at the end of her life to "let her wait" and transferred the owner to Xia Sheng. Obviously he couldn't wait any longer. Summer was the only one left to survive in the accident, and it was Atri who reached out to help in the darkness. Like many tear-jerking gals, it is precisely because they redeem each other that they come out of the shadows, and their souls meet and bond.

### "I hate Xia Sheng now."
Atri shows wishes in front of the scene, and sadness is revealed. The desire to be saved, the desire for the earth to be saved, points out the importance of the agreement. When Xia Sheng was immersed in the joy of Atri's confession, he suddenly discovered that "Atri only acted to please him" and collapsed immediately, hoping that Atri would "stop pretending". In fact, Atri has been suppressing his true self and heart for many years, and has been confused and wandering. After that, the Qi holding that should continue to develop turns to a burnout-like period. Xia Sheng once said, "I don't want to save the earth anymore, I just want to be with Atri." This is obviously a sign of sinking (saying no to messing up), so Atri doesn't agree with it. Xia Sheng knew that Atri was about to die soon, and hoped to spend a good time with him. He is not angry because he was deceived. He loves Atri deeply. He is still thinking about Atri. He reads the information every day and hopes to save Atri. As Atri's deeds are discovered, readers can also understand. It doesn't matter whether Atri accepts him or not. In the intertwining of contradictions, the mystery is revealed. Don't you think it's cool (ah?). True feelings in times of crisis are rare and highly contagious. A normal person would definitely be heartbroken when encountering some cognitive conflicts. The male protagonist was also very disappointed because he did not abandon Atri (I had an idea when I was watching it, but the truth was unexpected. Atri is a genuine first love worth fighting for) , the male protagonist does not try to please her, but works hard for her, takes action, and continues to write a glorious chapter of redemption. In fact, in atri, "I confess that I have been 'cheating' and have no heart." Does that mean that I will never be able to convey my feelings, so I won't work hard? The male protagonist is working hard for Atri, trying to save her, and he doesn't even give up, "She actually has a heart, maybe" and finally influences her sleeping heart. Atri's heart problems, in addition to hurting people at Shicai School, and after being recalled, the researcher asked her to "stop pretending to have feelings" (if she happened to meet the male protagonist). Watching, of course (because it is a story wwww), a miracle!
