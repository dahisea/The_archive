TG is required to use an email address to log in for authentication. You may need to use TG repeatedly to request verification code messages, probably more than 5 times.

The specific method is: log in to two telegrams (both official versions), one is used to apply for a verification code, and the other is used to kick out the newly logged-in device

Repeat the cycle, and then you will see the e-mail verification window pop up in Telegram, and you can turn on the e-mail address login authentication.
